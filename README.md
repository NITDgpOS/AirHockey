#About Air Hockey
This is a two player game. There are two paddles and a puck. The left-paddle (Player 1) can be moved using WASD keys and the right-paddle (Player 2) can be moved by the arrow keys. The puck hits the upper and lower boundaries and gets reflected and if it goes past the paddle, it is point for the other one.
